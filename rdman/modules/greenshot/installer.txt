Here are some details about Greenshot that might be handy for silent/mass installations.
The information in this text file is only for Greenshot versions 0.8.1 (build >=760)

INSTALLER
The Greenshot installer is made with Inno Setup, see http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
For command line options of the installer see: http://www.jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=setupcmdline
Additionally some Greenshot options can also be passed to the installer, these are the /norun and /configure options.
Passed to the installer these work exactly like using them with the Greenshot.exe when installed!

Important facts to the installer:
1) When doing a normal installation and Greenshot is running the installer will show this, Greenshot needs to be terminated.
2) When doing a silent installation and Greenshot is running the installer will kill Greenshot itself.
3) Installations where configure options are passed will only work for the user that started the installation!
	Work is being done to fix this in a newer Greenshot but this is currently a limitation.
4) Installations done as Admin will be available to all users. (configure options will not!)
	This is also for the "Start Greenshot with Windows start", when installing as Admin this is for all users!


GREENSHOT Configuration

Greenshot has a greenshot.ini file for the configuration, you can change this file at any time and Greenshot will reload the settings.


Greenshot commandline options:

        /help
                This help

        /exit
                Try to close all running instances, could be used for installers

        /openfile [filename]
                Open the bitmap file in the running Greenshot instance or start a new instance
				
		/norun
				Use as last option if you don't want the started executable to spawn a Greenshot instance.
				e.g. when you only want to change settings but don't want to have a running Greenshot afterwards.
