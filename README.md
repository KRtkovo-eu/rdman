Remote Desktop Manager
======================

At the beginning, Remote Desktop Manager (RDMan) was just a simple wrapper for Windows Remote Desktop Connection client (mstsc.exe) which I wrote because another solution was nothing for me, also I needed to train my programming skills.
As the time flows, my requirements was changing so now, Remote Desktop Manager is now wrapping also VNC or Putty, all on the one place!
You can store different credentials and different settings for each record in sources list. And source can be literally everything - every application can be added and monitored by RDMan. This feature is very popular among users with multiple screens.
